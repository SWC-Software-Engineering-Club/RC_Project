## RC Self-driving Car Project

Our project aims to immerse ourselves in the realm of AI/ML by applying these cutting-edge technologies to a tangible real-world application: building a self-driving RC car. Through this endeavor, we aspire to gain valuable experience across multiple domains, including hardware integration, software development, and ML algorithm implementation. By embracing in-demand concepts such as deep learning, we strive to deepen our understanding and proficiency in these transformative technologies.

Beyond technical skills, our project offers an opportunity to hone essential soft skills such as collaboration and leadership within a team setting. Through collaborative efforts, we aim to leverage each team member's strengths to overcome challenges and achieve our shared goal of successfully completing the RC project. This endeavor serves as a platform for us to take initiative, demonstrate leadership, and cultivate expertise in the rapidly evolving field of ML.
